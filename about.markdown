My name is Billy McMonagle. I'm a Data Engineer, and I haven't had my own site since Geocities was still a thing. I work at Arcadia, where we are building a tech platform to make clean energy accessible nationwide.

Previously, I worked in the exciting world of legal consulting, where I learned programming on the job in order to automate the boring stuff. On this site, I'll be writing here about tech topics that interest me, focusing on Python and cloud stuff.

This site is hosted on Github Pages and is built with Jekyll, using the Minima theme.
